## How to run any chapter code?

Make to have installed [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
> In the root of this folder run:
```
yarn install
```

After the installation of all modules you can run whathever package you want via this options:
- You can use an utility script (start.sh) to run from the root folder any chapter code, **ONLY if you use Unix or Mac system.**
- Simple move to the corresponding chapter code and run the local scripts situated in the package.json.
- Use `yarn workspace package-name script`
- Use `lerna run package-name script`

If you want to use the [start.sh](/start.sh) script accepts two arguments:
  - The chapter package, follows the convention of chapter-[number]
  - The script to run:
    - dev
    - build
    - serve
    - test

For ex:
```sh
# Will start the development server of chapter 6 code
./start.sh chapter-6 dev
# or will build the chapter 5 code
./start.sh chapter-5 build
```

There a lot of scripts and every chapter has it's own so feel free to take a look first on the chapter code which commands are available.
